# ‚öîÔ∏è Roblox Combat Project

Hello! I'm **Peter**, an 18-year-old developer passionate about **game development**, **reverse engineering**, and exploring the **inner workings of computers**.  
This project serves as my **first in-depth public documentation** of my custom Roblox Combat System ‚Äî a culmination of everything I‚Äôve learned so far.  
Expect continuous updates as the system evolves! :)

---

## üéØ Motivation & Vision

I‚Äôve always wanted to build a **combat system that‚Äôs both deeply versatile and cinematic**, combining the precision of **real-life combat mechanics** with the flair of **anime-style action**.  
My ultimate goal is to create a **true power fantasy** ‚Äî a game where players feel unstoppable and in full control of their destructive abilities.

The system draws heavy inspiration from **Batman‚Äôs Free-Flow Combat** mechanics.

## üåÄ Core Combat Features

- **Interactive environmental takedowns** for cinematic finishes  
- **Multi-chain combo attacks**, allowing players to vary the intensity of strikes  
- **Scalable special moves** ‚Äî control how much energy you channel into each attack  
- **Randomized animation variants** for natural and fluid combat flow  
- **Enemy-linked takedowns**, turning dodging into a precise, dance-like maneuver that redirects attacks  
- **Auto-dodge mechanic** that instantly blocks and counters when perfectly timed  
- **Custom ragdoll physics system**, built from scratch to go beyond Roblox‚Äôs default physics

## üß© Systems Overview

This project consists of multiple interconnected systems, designed to work together seamlessly:

- [Modules](#modules)  
- [Animations](#animations)  
- [Scripts](#scripts)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modules

### üî¶ Ray Module

<img width="1300" height="759" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b1060f-ae2f-48dc-8aa5-4ae2603d5dfa" />

The **Ray Module** is responsible for all raycasting logic.  
It will be used for:  
- Detecting hit points (smash points, projectiles, etc.)  
- Measuring object bounds and world positions  
- Handling all environment-aware combat calculations  

This is one of the **core building blocks** of the combat system.

---

## üß† Scripts

### üíª Client

All gameplay logic runs **entirely on the client**.  
The only communication with the server will handle **saving data** and **long-term persistence**.

---

#### üß© Variables & Environment

All scripts, modules, and instance values are located under **StarterPlayerScripts** for easy access and organization.

<img width="830" height="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc61471-6919-4f68-be8f-c4bde305b822" />

This structure ensures clean navigation and maintainability.  
For example, to access a player‚Äôs money value stored in a `Values` folder:

    script.Parent.Values.Money

You can also see another example below when referencing the `Rays` module:

<img width="1713" height="318" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a4bb83e-0e3b-4ed9-b5ee-cca900a368f6" />

We define essential **services** (e.g., `Players`, `ReplicatedStorage`) and workspace folders to manage organization and object exclusion during raycasts.  
Additionally, mouse input will be used for **interactive UI events**, covered later on.

---

#### üß± Types

<img width="1046" height="551" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d85710-8eb0-45b6-a699-07fcb925eb28" />

I generally don‚Äôt rely heavily on **types** in Lua because of the language‚Äôs flexible handling of objects.  
Here, the use of `type` mainly serves readability rather than strict type safety ‚Äî since Lua doesn‚Äôt risk memory corruption from improper casting.

<img width="672" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0403db6e-7068-456d-9c0f-0d5506977abe" />

<img width="730" height="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec648650-5042-4772-92f9-7899a00fc715" />

This setup manages player character initialization, handling events like spawning, death, and cleanup.  
Animations are loaded and stored in a centralized table for quick access, and safely disconnected when the character resets.

---

#### üí• Smash Wall & Basic Concepts

This defines the core structure of abilities and input handling, designed for easy customization and modular expansion.

<img width="458" height="149" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c3ced2-35f5-47aa-be10-ba9d5480e353" />

Each ability stores key data such as **last activation time**, **active status**, and **bound input key**.  
This format keeps the system flexible and scalable.

<img width="916" height="706" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ecf535-f6af-485e-ba54-784f1ffa2bfa" />

The example above shows how the **Smash Wall** ability detects interactable surfaces.  
It fires a ray from the camera‚Äôs direction, checks distance thresholds, and assigns the detected wall as the target for the smash sequence.

This ensures realism ‚Äî players won‚Äôt float or clip mid-air when activating the ability.  

Once triggered, the ability executes a cinematic sequence involving debris, physics impulses, and layered animations.  
The player fades, teleports, and performs synchronized animations that blend seamlessly with the environment.

These are the functions used for smash wall and I will go more in depth : 

```lua

local interacting_point_vis_min = create_instance("Part",{
	Parent = workspace,
	Color = Color3.fromRGB(255,0,0),
	Anchored = true,
	Material = Enum.Material.Neon,
	Size = Vector3.new(1,1,1),
	CanCollide = false
})

local interacting_point_vis_max = create_instance("Part",{
	Parent = workspace,
	Color = Color3.fromRGB(255,0,0),
	Anchored = true,
	Material = Enum.Material.Neon,
	Size = Vector3.new(1,1,1),
	CanCollide = false
})

---combat functions

local used_keys = {"E"}
local smash_wall;
local q_events = {}
local current_wall,current_smash_point,current_position,wall_normal
local active_abilities : abilties;

local character_fade = function(new_cords : CFrame) 
	local original_cf = lchar.body_parts.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame

	for i,v in pairs(lchar.body_parts) do 
		local part = v:Clone()
		part.Parent = workspace
		part.Transparency = 0.7
		part.CanCollide = false
		part.Anchored = true
		part.Size = v.Size 
		part.CFrame = v.CFrame
		part.Material = Enum.Material.ForceField
		part.Color = Color3.fromRGB(0,124,233)
		game:GetService("Debris"):AddItem(part,0.2)
	end
end

local lowest_surface_from_pos = function(position : CFrame) : Vector3
	if not lchar then return end
	local root = lchar.body_parts.HumanoidRootPart
	local results = ray_casting.shoot_ray({
		distance = -1000,
		orig = position.Position,
		dir = root.CFrame.UpVector,
		ignores = {lchar.self},
	})

	return results and results.Position
end
```

There‚Äôs a lot happening under the hood in these systems ‚Äî from **timing-based animation sequencing** to **custom physics manipulation**.  
I‚Äôll continue walking through each part of the combat pipeline soon and explain the design logic in depth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

Taking a short break for now, but this project will be my **main focus** going forward.  
I‚Äôm fully committed to pushing Roblox‚Äôs engine to its limits and showcasing what‚Äôs possible with creativity and technical precision.
