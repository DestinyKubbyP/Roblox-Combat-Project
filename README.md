# ⚔️ Roblox Combat Project

Hello! I'm **Peter**, an 18-year-old developer passionate about **game development**, **reverse engineering**, and exploring the **inner workings of computers**.  
This project serves as my **first in-depth public documentation** of my custom Roblox Combat System — a culmination of everything I’ve learned so far.  
Expect continuous updates as the system evolves! :)

---

## 🎯 Motivation & Vision

I’ve always wanted to build a **combat system that’s both deeply versatile and cinematic**, combining the precision of **real-life combat mechanics** with the flair of **anime-style action**.  
My ultimate goal is to create a **true power fantasy** — a game where players feel unstoppable and in full control of their destructive abilities.

The system draws heavy inspiration from **Batman’s Free-Flow Combat** mechanics.

## 🌀 Core Combat Features

- **Interactive environmental takedowns** for cinematic finishes  
- **Multi-chain combo attacks**, allowing players to vary the intensity of strikes  
- **Scalable special moves** — control how much energy you channel into each attack  
- **Randomized animation variants** for natural and fluid combat flow  
- **Enemy-linked takedowns**, turning dodging into a precise, dance-like maneuver that redirects attacks  
- **Auto-dodge mechanic** that instantly blocks and counters when perfectly timed  
- **Custom ragdoll physics system**, built from scratch to go beyond Roblox’s default physics

## 🧩 Systems Overview

This project consists of multiple interconnected systems, designed to work together seamlessly:

- [Modules](#modules)  
- [Animations](#animations)  
- [Scripts](#scripts)

## ⚙️ Modules

### 🔦 Ray Module

<img width="1300" height="759" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b1060f-ae2f-48dc-8aa5-4ae2603d5dfa" />

The **Ray Module** is responsible for all raycasting logic.  
It will be used for:  
- Detecting hit points (smash points, projectiles, etc.)  
- Measuring object bounds and world positions  
- Handling all environment-aware combat calculations  

This is one of the **core building blocks** of the combat system.

## 🧠 Scripts

### 💻 Client

All gameplay logic runs **entirely on the client**.  
The only communication with the server will handle **saving data** and **long-term persistence**.

---

#### 🧩 Variables & Environment

All scripts, modules, and instance values are located under **StarterPlayerScripts** for easy access and organization.

<img width="830" height="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc61471-6919-4f68-be8f-c4bde305b822" />

This structure ensures clean navigation and maintainability.  
For example, to access a player’s money value stored in a `Values` folder:

    script.Parent.Values.Money

You can also see another example below when referencing the `Rays` module:

<img width="1713" height="318" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a4bb83e-0e3b-4ed9-b5ee-cca900a368f6" />

We define essential **services** (e.g., `Players`, `ReplicatedStorage`) and workspace folders to manage organization and object exclusion during raycasts.  
Additionally, mouse input will be used for **interactive UI events**, covered later on.

---

#### 🧱 Types

<img width="1046" height="551" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25d85710-8eb0-45b6-a699-07fcb925eb28" />

I generally don’t rely heavily on **types** in Lua because of the language’s flexible handling of objects.  
Here, the use of `type` mainly serves readability rather than strict type safety — since Lua doesn’t risk memory corruption from improper casting.

<img width="672" height="194" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0403db6e-7068-456d-9c0f-0d5506977abe" />

<img width="730" height="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec648650-5042-4772-92f9-7899a00fc715" />

This setup manages player character initialization, handling events like spawning, death, and cleanup.  
Animations are loaded and stored in a centralized table for quick access, and safely disconnected when the character resets.

---

#### 💥 Smash Wall & Basic Concepts

This defines the core structure of abilities and input handling, designed for easy customization and modular expansion.

<img width="458" height="149" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c3ced2-35f5-47aa-be10-ba9d5480e353" />

Each ability stores key data such as **last activation time**, **active status**, and **bound input key**.  
This format keeps the system flexible and scalable.

<img width="916" height="706" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ecf535-f6af-485e-ba54-784f1ffa2bfa" />

The example above shows how the **Smash Wall** ability detects interactable surfaces.  
It fires a ray from the camera’s direction, checks distance thresholds, and assigns the detected wall as the target for the smash sequence.

This ensures realism — players won’t float or clip mid-air when activating the ability.  

Once triggered, the ability executes a cinematic sequence involving debris, physics impulses, and layered animations.  
The player fades, teleports, and performs synchronized animations that blend seamlessly with the environment.

---

There’s a lot happening under the hood in these systems — from **timing-based animation sequencing** to **custom physics manipulation**.  
I’ll continue walking through each part of the combat pipeline soon and explain the design logic in depth.

## 🛠️ Notes

Taking a short break for now, but this project will be my **main focus** going forward.  
I’m fully committed to pushing Roblox’s engine to its limits and showcasing what’s possible with creativity and technical precision.
